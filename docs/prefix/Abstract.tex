\section*{Abstract}

This student research project deals with the development of an application for managing shift changes using the Google Design Sprint. First, a UX and user concept was developed to ensure the user-friendliness and effectiveness of the application. Following this, a user survey was conducted to gather feedback from users. This survey aimed to find out how the design was received by users, whether the application was intuitive and what suggestions for improvement or additional information users would like to see. The results of the survey were carefully analyzed. It turned out that the users generally liked the design, but that there were individual suggestions for improvement and a request for additional information. Based on these results, the user concept was modified to better meet the needs and wishes of the users. In the final phase of development, a prototype was created with Angular based on the updated user concept. This serves as the basis for further development and refinement of the application to ensure an optimal user experience.
